# Summary

I needed a little stand to hold my Raspberry Pi Touchscreen on my desk while I'm working on software for it. You need to print two of the legs. It needs four M3 screws to attach the them. M3x10mm screws will work but M3x12mm with a washer works even better. I printed mine with 20% infill.

This is for the 7" touchscreen made by the Raspberry Pi Foundation. https://www.raspberrypi.org/blog/the-eagerly-awaited-raspberry-pi-display/

[UPDATE 2016-03-27]
I noticed recently the glass on my touchscreen had slid down out of alignment with display underneath. It appears over time the heat of the display backlight causes the double stick tape between the glass and display to soften. If unsupported the glass begins to slide down. Mine had moved down about 5mm. To address this problem I uploaded a new version of the stand that has a lip for the glass to rest on and prevent this. I was able to push the glass back into place with the help of a heat gun. Also included in this update is a version with a notch cutout to allow for USB powering of the display.

# Print Settings

Printer Brand: Printrbot
Printer: Simple Black
Rafts: Doesn't Matter
Supports: Doesn't Matter
Infill: 20%

# Post-Printing

I put little round rubber feet (the kind that come with the Arduino UNO) on the bottom of the legs so it didn't slide around on my desk.
